//JavaScript is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
//As of 2024, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
//All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

//JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
//It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

//JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive".
//The programs in this language are called scripts.
//They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
//Scripts are provided and executed in the user's device/browser, rather than on the web server, 
//which makes JavaScript faster than server-side programming languages that need to communicate with a server in order to run code.

//JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

//Client-side developments: 
//JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting where scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run on the user's browser. 
//This allows for interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. Examples include form validation, dynamic content updates, animations, and handling user events.

//Server-side developments:
//With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development. 
//Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling the creation of scalable network applications. 
//This has led to the rise of full-stack JavaScript development, where both the client and server sides of an application are built using JavaScript.

//JavaScript can also be used in non-web environments such as mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native), desktop applications (using Electron), and even game development.
